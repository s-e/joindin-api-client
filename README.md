joindin-api-client
==================

##Intent:

Modularising the collection of data from api.joind.in.

##Aims:

* to give the joind.in reponsive web2 project a nicely bundled and loosely-coupled component for consuming and updating joind.in data.
* to provide an option for other consumers to integrate the joind.in api into their sites or projects with minimal hassle.
* to make distribution of core api changes to consumers a simple, automated task.
